One day, a Rabbit was sitting under a tree. 
He was wondering what would happen if the forest caught on fire
Suddenly, he saw something orange, and it looked as if it resembled a flame

He began shouting "LOOK OUT! FIRE IN THE FOREST, WE MUST RUN!"

All the animals, 
the Monkeys, Crocodile, Chimpanzees, Zebras, Rabbits, Moose, Deer, Elephant, Bulls, 
Tigers, Hounds, and Wolves followed the rabbit and ran, scared out of their lives. The fire
was going up, not spreading through the forest, and it looked far to some of the animals, 
but that didn't matter. They were running and causing havoc around the forest.

Then the king of the Forest, the Lion, Roared "SCILENCE!"
Everybody in the forest stopped dead in their tracks.
The Lion looked around and said "Who is responsible for the stampede!" he yelled.
There was a lot of confusion, and eventually, it all came down to the Rabbit, and he claimned
he saw it with his own eyes.

The Lion went with the rabbit to see if it was an actual fire, but it turned out to be a bunch
of friendly humans just using a campfire. The Lion went back into the forest, with the rabbit. 

"My friends." He said. You have been fooled. It was not a real fire, but a campfire. 
This is why you should see for yourself if someone is telling the truth." 
The rabbit hung his head in shame
